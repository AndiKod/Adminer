# Adminer

Just a "drop'n'use" Adminer folder, with SQLite password pluging configured.

- Clone the repo in the root of your XAMPP install, at the same level with your other projects.
- Navigate to `localhost/adminer/sqlite.php` and use `letmein` as password
- Open a database by speciffying the path to the file like `../someProject/db/dbFile.sqlite`

As of now it use an alternate css theme, and eventually I'll look into it to refresh the UI.
